        <h1>Builds for Fishing</h1>
        <p>Fishing is a small game about a fisherman in ancient Greece. It's currently in development by me, Thomas Viktil, and it's open source. These are the published builds of the game.</p>
        <p>Whenever I feel I have something to show, I deploy a build to this page.</p>
        <p>I post updates on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/mandarinx">@mandarinx</a>), and you can follow, star or fork the entire project at <a href="https://github.com/mandarinx/fishing">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>The game is made with JavaScript and <a href="http://phaser.io">Phaser</a> on a Node.js server.</p>
